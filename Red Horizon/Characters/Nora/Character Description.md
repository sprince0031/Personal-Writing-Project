The Nuera (New Era - play on "neural") device is a brain interfacing device attached to the base of one's skull. It provides users with native AR capabilities since it can inteface with the optical cortex of the brain and transmit signals that work as if you have AR interfaces in your field of view.

The Nuera's fundamental way of ineracting with its user is through its AI voice assistant, Nora. She is a constant companion, a literal voice in your head. 

#### Additional functionality:
- It has a universal unique identifier (UUID) which essentially acts as a MAC address for human users. This is every citizen's ID and should be accessible at all times when in Cygnus martian territory.

#### Hidden features:
- Controls the endocrine system of a user and can manipulate the Hypothalamus to regulate Dopamine levels. This influences the decisions of a citizen.
