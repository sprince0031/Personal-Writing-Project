OLD OUTLINE FOR REFERENCE

- Mention sleep tracking senses disturbed sleep.
- Origin of the Martiani: fight breaks out in a bar and few drops of blood are spilt in an ordinary martini turning it red like Mars. 
- On Mars, because there is no international law that mandates any country to lay claim to any land, the giant corporations that first go there form the administrative policies and govern Martian land.
- Every citizen born in a corporate country are employees of that company with a minimum pay and are educated and trained towards the requirements of the company.
- The Martian land is the "app store" or platform. Other businesses setting up shop on Martian land has to pay the platform tax as mandated by the ruling corporation just like apps on the apple app store or on Google's play store.
- They're the new Mafia where they provide security and the employees for these businesses. 
- There is a minimum number of employees that are provided for the base "app store" tax. As the business expands, and the requirement increases, additional tax needs to be payed.
- As a result, there is "employee" trafficking where businesses smuggle in people from outside the country to work for their company. These smuggled people aren't fitted with the neuralink type of device that registers a citizen's identity. They're quality of life is also not good because they have to stay hidden for their own saftey.
- These smuggled employees are sent from earth where there are "shaddy" organizations training them. They are also made to believe that Mars is the future and Earth is becoming fast inhospitable. So they find this as a means of escape.
- There are three (or four? Or just 2?) rival corporations on Mars. There is one which is the biggest. And then the other two which are big but not as big as the first.
- Side note: quality of life for citizens (focusing mainly on the main corporate country) is decent where all basic needs are either free or heavily subsidized (although data is also taken).
